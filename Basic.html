        <!-- <Body> & <P> Explanation -->
        opening tag begins with "body" and closing tag ends with "/body"
        p is the opening tag for a paragraph element in HTML. It is used to define a block of text that is a paragraph. The closing tag for a paragraph is.</p>

        <!-- <h1> to <h6> Explanation -->
        suppose you want to add headline to your document, you can use the h1 tag for the main title, h2 for subheadings, and so on up to h6 for smaller headings. For example:
            <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
            <h2>Heading level 2</h2>
            <h3>Heading level 3</h3>
            <h4>Heading level 4</h4>
            <h5>Heading level 5</h5>
            <h6>Heading level 6</h6>
        Note: Only one h1 element should be used in a .html file.

        <!-- <br> Explanation -->
        Suppose we want to add a new line in the paragraph, we can use the <br> tag. This tag is a self-closing tag and does not require a closing tag. For example:
        <p>This is a paragraph.<br>This is a new line in the same paragraph.</p>

        <!-- text formatting tags -->
        <b>element to bold text</b>
        <i>element to italicize text</i>
        <u>element to underline text</u>
        <s>element to strikethrough text</s>
            example of text formatting:
